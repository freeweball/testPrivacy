If the transfer of data outside the EU/EEA is not regulated by an EU Commission sufficiency decision, we base on the legal guarantees set out in Article 46 et al. Seqq. GDPR. This mainly includes EU Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses, which we have strengthened with additional security measures such as additional individual risk assessment, additional contractual guarantees, and technical guarantees, including multi-factor authentication data access, additional encryption, security threat detection systems, to enable international transfers with our affiliates and partners outside the EU/EEA.

					<h2>Cookies</h2>
					<p>We and our partners, such as marketing and analytics partners, may use “cookies,” which are text files placed on the computers of users of the Games and website to help us analyze how you use the Games and website, as well as similar technologies (e.g., web beacons, pixels, ad tags, and device identifiers) to recognize the use of the Games and website across different devices and our services. These are also used to improve our services, marketing, analytics, or website functionality. The use of cookies is standard on the internet. You will be prompted to provide your consent for cookies when visiting our website. You may adjust your browser settings to prevent the reception of cookies or to provide notification whenever a cookie is sent to you. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. However, please note that if you do this, you may not be able to access the full functionality of our Games and websites.</p>
					<p>Website traffic volume and information pertaining to the Games, such as the number of visitors to a given game or website on a daily basis, is typically referred to as “tracking data.” This type of indirectly collected information is gathered through various means, such as an IP address, which is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you use online resources. Web servers — the computers that “serve up” web pages — automatically identify computers by their IP addresses. When you visit any of our websites, our servers log the computer’s IP address.</p>
					<p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our data and information privacy practices. </p>
